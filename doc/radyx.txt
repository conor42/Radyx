    Introduction
===============================================================================

Radyx is a file archiver which creates archives in the 7-zip format using only
the LZMA2 compression algorithm provided by the Fast LZMA2 Library.

The library uses a parallel buffered radix matchfinder to enable multithreaded
compression without splitting the input into large chunks or duplicating the
entire matchfinder/encoder combination for every 2 threads. The RMF also has
greater time and memory efficiency, using about 5.5x the dictionary size
instead of 11.5 x for BT4. This rises to 6.5x for dictionary sizes above 64Mb.
The library also uses a modified LZMA2 encoder employing speed tweaks from
Zstandard. The result is faster compression in less RAM, especially when using
4+ threads.

The RMF is a block algorithm, which reduces the effective dictionary size. This
results in slightly less compression than BT4 for a given dictionary size. To
compensate, you can raise the compression level (the most efficient way) or set
high-compression mode using -ma=3 on the command line.

The radix match finder only finds the longest match (up to the fast length
value) which slightly decreases compression performance when using optimized
encoding (level 4 and up). To compensate, Radyx has a hybrid mode which adds a
small sliding window dictionary and hash chain. This is enabled at level 8 and
above.

    Radyx 0.9.2 Command Line
===============================================================================

The command line format is 7-zip compatible wherever possible:

radyx a [<switch>...] <base_archive_name> [<arguments>...]

<arguments> ::= <switch> | <wildcard> | <filename> | <list_file>
<switch>::= -<switch_characters>[<option>]
<list_file> ::= @{filename}

The '/' switch character is not supported for portability reasons.

Extraction is not supported in this version, so 7-zip or a compatible program
must be used for this. The only valid command is 'a' to add files to a new
archive.

See the 7-zip documentation for more details about switches. The -mb switch has
a different meaning in Radyx and extra switches (-ar, -mds, -mo, -msd, -q) have
been added. The -ma switch has an expanded range of values.

The following switches are recognized:

--
   Stop switch parsing (allows archive names starting with '-')

-ar=<on|off>
   Asynchronous reading of input files. Allows compression to occur while
   reading data. This increases the memory requirement by one dictionary size.

-i[<recurse_type>]<file_ref>
   <recurse_type> ::= r[- | 0]
   <file_ref> ::= @{listfile} | !{wildcard}
   Specifies additional filenames to include.

-ma=<0|1|2|3>
   Set compression mode: 0 = fast, 1 = normal, 2 = best (hybrid), 3 = enable
   high-compression levels (1 - 9). Default is 2.

-mb={N}  (6 - 12)
   *** Note: different from 7-zip. Coder binding is fixed in Radyx.
   Set buffer relative logarithmic size for buffering of linked lists. The
   buffer size is calculated as 2 ^ (dictionary_log - buffer_log). Note the
   inverse relationship between the parameter and the actual size. Higher
   values raise speed and decrease compression.

-md={N}[b|k|m|g]  (1 Mb - 1 Gb)
   Set the dictionary size. Default is 16 Mb. A maximum dictionary size of
   1/16th of the total RAM installed in the computer is recommended.

-mds={N}[b|k]  (16 b - 16 kb)
   Set the secondary dictionary size for hybrid mode.

-mf=<on|off>
   Enable / disable BCJ filtering for executable files. Default is on.

-mfb={N}  (even numbers 6 - 273)
   Set fast length (fast bytes). When a match of at least this length is
   encountered, it is encoded without any further attempt at optimization.
   Default is 48.

-mlc={N}  (0 - 4)
   Set the number of literal context bits. Default is 3.

-mlp={N}  (0 - 4)
   Set the number of literal position bits. Default is 0.

-mmc={N}
   Set the number of match cycles (hybrid mode only). Default is 1.

-mmt={N}  (1 - number of cores)
   Set the number of threads to use. This should not be greater than the
   number of CPU cores in your computer, which is the default.

-mo={N}  (1 - 14)
   Set the overlap between consecutive data blocks, in units of 1/16th of the
   dictionary size. Default is 2. It is typically better to increase the
   dictionary size than the overlap for higher compression.

-mpb={N}
   Set the number of position bits. Default is 2.

-ms=<off | on | [e] [{N}f] [{N}[b|k|m|g]]>
   Enables or disables solid mode. The default is on. In solid mode, files are
   grouped together for compression which normally improves the compression
   ratio.
   e            Use a separate solid block for each new file extension
   {N}f         Set the limit for number of files in one solid block
   {N}[b|k|m|g] Set the limit for the total size of a solid block in bytes

-msd={N}  (even numbers 6 - 254)
   Set search depth. String matches will be resolved up to this length. This
   will be rounded down to an even number.

-mtc=<off|on>
   Store file creation timestamps.

-mx={N}  (1 - 12 or 1 - 9)
   Set compression parameters to efficiently target a given level of
   compression. This is the optimal way to control compression ratio in most
   cases. If high-compression mode is enabled (-ma=3), parameters will be set
   to gain the most compression from a given dictionary size, where 1 = 1 Mb
   and 9 = 256 Mb. 

-q
   Set quiet mode. Only errors and warnings will be displayed.

-r[- | 0]
   Recurse subdirectories. Append '-' to disable (default) or '0' to recurse
   for wildcards only.

-spf
   Store full path names.

-ssw
   Compress files that are open for writing.

-w{dir_path}
   Set working directory.

-x[<recurse_type>]<file_ref>
   <recurse_type> ::= r[- | 0]
   <file_ref> ::= @{listfile} | !{wildcard}
   Specifies filenames or wildcards to exclude from the archive. If recursion
   is enabled, the exclusion can include a path which must match part or all
   of the path of files to be excluded, starting from the directory where
   recursion will begin.
